<h1>R Projects Repository</h1>

<p>Welcome to my R Projects repository! This collection showcases some of the projects I’ve worked on using R, focusing on data analysis, prediction challenges, and machine learning. Below is an overview of each project folder included in this repository:</p>

<h2>1. Prediction Challenges</h2>
<p>This folder contains my submissions for the <strong>QUINLAN data prediction challenges</strong>, completed as part of Data 101 with Professor Tomasz Imielinski. Throughout the semester, I consistently performed in the top 10 on the course leaderboard for prediction challenges. This repository highlights the challenges where I achieved the highest scores.</p>

<h2>2. Premier League Data Project</h2>
<p>Created during Data 101 and later extended in my personal time, this 4-part project dives into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bayesian Theory:</strong> Applying Bayesian methods for probabilistic insights.</li>
<li><strong>Sampling:</strong> Using statistical techniques for robust data analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> Exploring key questions through statistical inference.</li>
<li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Leveraging <code>ggplot2</code> for impactful visual representations.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final output includes a detailed write-up in article format, with an emphasis on creating the snappiest and most engaging titles for each section.</p>

<h2>3. Rutgers DSC Datathon</h2>
<p>This folder documents my work for the <strong>Rutgers University Data Science Club Fall 2023 Datathon</strong>, where I developed the most accurate forecasting model using NOAA temperature anomaly data. By experimenting with various time series forecasting techniques, I optimized an <strong>XGBoost</strong> model to achieve the lowest error rates, securing first place in the competition. This project marked my first experience with R and provided an invaluable introduction to the language and predictive analytics.</p>

<p>Winning the datathon was a proud achievement, and the insights gained have laid a strong foundation for my future endeavors in data science.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about these projects or are interested in collaborating on future projects, I’d love to hear from you! Connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-mandryk/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
